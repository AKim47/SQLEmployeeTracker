# SQLEmployeeTracker

## Description
Through the use of MYSQL, Node, and Inquirer, I created a terminal-based program that prompts the user to view departments, roles, or employees, as well as add departments, roles, or employee. After the prompt, the program will then search a database via MYSQL to add and return the corresponding inputs.
